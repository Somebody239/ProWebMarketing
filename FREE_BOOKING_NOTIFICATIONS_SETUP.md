### 3. Enhanced Email via EmailJS (Optional)

## EmailJS Setup (Optional Enhancement)

To enable automatic email sending without customer action:

1. **Create EmailJS Account**:
   - Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
   - Create a free account
   - Create a new service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Create an email template

2. **Get Your Credentials**:
   - Service ID: Found in EmailJS dashboard
   - Template ID: Found in EmailJS dashboard  
   - Public Key: Found in EmailJS dashboard

3. **Add Environment Variables**:
   Create/update your `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   ```

4. **EmailJS Template Variables**:
   Your template should use these variables:
   - `{{customer_name}}`
   - `{{customer_email}}`
   - `{{customer_phone}}`
   - `{{preferred_date}}`
   - `{{preferred_time}}`
   - `{{message}}`
   - `{{booking_type}}`

## How It Works

1. **Customer fills out booking form**
2. **Customer selects notification method**:
   - Send Text Message (opens SMS app with pre-filled message)
   - Send Email (opens email client with pre-filled email)
   - Both Text & Email (opens both apps)
3. **Customer sends the message** (just one tap/click)
4. **You receive the booking details instantly**
